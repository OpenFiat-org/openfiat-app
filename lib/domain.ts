/**
 * Domain-separated signing preimages (F-01).
 *
 * A node verifies client-signed events over
 * `preimage(tag, payload) = len(tag):u32be ‖ utf8(tag) ‖ json(payload)`
 * rather than bare `json(payload)`. Binding the payload's type into the
 * signed bytes is what stops a signature made for one event type being
 * replayed as a different event type that happens to share the same JSON
 * shape — see `openfiat-core`'s `crates/serialization/src/domain.rs` for
 * the full rationale, which this module mirrors exactly (and matches the
 * TS SDK's own `src/domain.ts`, a self-contained copy rather than a shared
 * import so this app has no runtime dependency on the SDK for signing).
 *
 * The tag is length-prefixed rather than merely concatenated so that
 * `(tag, payload)` pairs are unambiguous: without the length prefix, a tag
 * ending in the prefix of another plus a payload whose first bytes make up
 * the difference could still collide.
